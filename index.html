    <p>Welcome to MeltedCarbon's website. I am just starting to learn HTML, so this is the first website I have ever made on my own.</p>
    <p>I am a student at <b>Seneca High School</b> in <b>Louisville, Kentucky</b>. I am in their Law & IT pathway and in the programming classes. I have been working on Python projects, some personal and some for school. "<b>MeltedCarbon</b>" is my <i>student alias</i> I will use for my school related work and projects.</p>

  <div id="tech">
    <h2>Tech</h2>
    <p>I grew up with technology, I had my first desktop PC at 3 years old. I have built my own PC several times, and I like tinkering around with various pieces of technology sometimes. I started trying to learn Python about 5 years ago, but didn't seriously learn it until a couple years ago. I learned from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw" target="_blank">this video</a>. Another great source of learning is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stack overflow</a>. I would say I'm a pretty decent amateur developer now. I joined the programming classes in my sophomore year, and started working on a few Python projects of my own. This year I started learning HTML, as you can tell.</p>

  <div id="astronomy"}>
    <h2>Astronomy</h2>
    <p>I've always loved astronomy ever since I've known about it. The NASA missions like the probes & rovers are the coolest thing to me. I mean, we can literally say that we've been to the world in our sky, how awesome is that?! I don't have the money to get a good telescope, but I have borrowed one from a friend and used it to observe a couple comets, Andromeda, the solar system, etc.<br><br>Mars Rover landing video, an incredible moment captured. A robot made by us landing on another planet.<br><iframe width="700" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4czjS9h4Fpg" title="Perseverance Roverâ€™s Descent and Touchdown on Mars (Official NASA Video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

  <div id="music">
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I joined the concert band in middle school as a percussionist, and that's where my love for playing musical instruments started. In that class I was learning to read music and play percussion instruments. I started learning to play the piano shortly thereafter, with songs from Queen. One of my sister's friends gave me a bass guitar, so I started learning to play famous basslines. I eventually picked up guitar, because my dad had an acoustic lying around in our house. It took me a few years to get started, but I eventually started seriously learning how to play it well. One of my favorite bands to play is Polyphia, because their playing style is so unique and fun yet decently challenging. I also play fingerstyle, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXTJBr9tt8Q" target="_blank">"Yesterday" by the Beatles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVPm5lgox78" target="_blank">"Love of my Life" by Queen</a> are my two favorites. I'm still in concert band at my high school as a percussionist to this day.</p>
